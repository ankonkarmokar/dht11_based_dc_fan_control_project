# DHT11-Based DC Fan Control Project

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to create an automated fan control system using the DHT11 sensor to monitor environmental conditions. The system adjusts the speed of a DC fan based on real-time temperature and humidity readings, ensuring optimal comfort and energy efficiency.

## Components Needed
- **DHT11 Sensor:** A temperature and humidity sensor to collect environmental data.
- **DC Fan:** A fan with a DC motor for adjustable speed control.
- **Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino):** To process sensor data and control the fan.
- **Transistor/MOSFET:** To interface between the microcontroller and the DC fan for speed control.
- **Power Supply:** To provide power to the microcontroller and fan.
- **Display (Optional):** An LCD display to show real-time temperature and humidity readings.

## Project Implementation

### Sensor Setup
- Connect the DHT11 sensor to the microcontroller (e.g., Arduino) to measure temperature and humidity.
- Write code to read data from the DHT11 sensor.

### Fan Control
- Connect the DC fan to the microcontroller through a transistor or MOSFET to control the fan speed.
- Develop a control algorithm in the microcontroller that adjusts the fan speed based on the temperature and humidity readings. For example, increase the fan speed if the temperature is high or if humidity surpasses a predefined threshold.

### User Interface (Optional)
- Implement a user interface for the system, which could be a simple LCD display showing real-time temperature, humidity, and fan speed.
- Alternatively, use serial communication to display information on a computer or another device.

### Calibration and Thresholds
- Set up calibration routines to ensure accurate sensor readings.
- Define temperature and humidity thresholds that trigger changes in the fan speed.

### Power Management
- Implement power-saving features, such as putting the microcontroller to sleep during periods of inactivity to conserve energy.

### Safety Features
- Include safety features to prevent the fan from operating at extremely high speeds or in conditions that could damage the system.

## Benefits
- **Energy Efficiency:** The system optimizes fan speed based on environmental conditions, reducing energy consumption.
- **Customization:** Users can customize temperature and humidity thresholds according to their preferences.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** The system provides real-time monitoring of environmental conditions and fan speed.

## Potential Enhancements
- Integration with IoT for remote monitoring and control.
- Mobile app or web interface for user-friendly control.
- Integration with other smart home systems.

This DHT11-based DC fan control project offers a practical and cost-effective solution for automated climate control in various environments, making it suitable for home applications or small-scale industrial settings.
